# Library-Management-System-Simulator
Collaborated with 3 other students on a Library Simulator, where we applied C++ code with object oriented programming, in which a user can borrow up to 5 items within a 30 day period. The user is forbidden from borrowing beyond the limit and if at least one of the items is flagged overdue.
